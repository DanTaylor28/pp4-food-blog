# My Food Blog PP4

The website I decided to make is a food blog which lets users visiting the site, explore numerous different recipes, while also sharing their own cooking tips and tricks. The goal of the blog site is to give people an easily accessible website to find delicious recipes, and to also give users their own platform to be able to share their love of cooking and baking with the world. This blog is aimed at anybody that has a passion for cooking and wants to discover new recipes or ideas. Also, people who just want to share their own thoughts and opinions on anything food related will feel welcome in this friendly, passionate community.

Users have the ability to register for an account and this will then allow them to like and comment on blog posts as well as giving them the ability to upload their very own posts and recipes. Any blogs uploaded by users will need to be verified and published by the site admin before it becomes live on the website. This is to ensure the content is relevant and that we do not become a platform where offensive or discriminatory views are being spread amongst our community. Comments are free to be posted by any registered users, but they too will be monitored for any remarks that breach our community standards.
